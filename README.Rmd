Flowers is a package for generating flower plots.  It was derived from code
from Jim Regetz at NCEAS, and then rewritten and extended by the OHI project.
This package formalizes the approach into an easily re-usable function
for generating custom flower plots for multiple scenarios.

## Quick Start

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a flower plot from an 
appropriately structured data set:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, out.width="70%"}
library(flowers)
data(ohi)
plot_flower(ohi, "OHI Example Flower")
```

Currently `plot_flower()` expects particular column names and semantics, but
this could be made more flexible.  See the structure of OHI for an example. In particular,
it uses columns `score`, `weight`, `name_flower`, and `name_supra` to create the plot.

By default the flower petals are colored proportionally to the `score` values as 
show in the OHI example above.  One can provide a color palette (`colors`) to the 
`plot_flower()` function to control the gradient used.

The `weight` variable controls the relative widths of the petals, and should range
from 0 to 1. The petal labels are taken from the `name_flower` variable, and the 
grouping category labels are taken from the `name_supra` variable. Other
columsn in the data frame are ignored.

```{r ohi_structure, echo=FALSE}
str(ohi)
```

Alternatively, by setting `fixed_colors = TRUE` you can also color the petals 
with discrete colors determined by the `name_flower` categories, in which case 
you will likely want to provide a `colors` palette with at least as many colors 
as you have petals in the plot. Here's an example with four fixed petals, in 
which we also provide only missing values to `name_supra` so that no grouping 
labels are used:

```{r fair_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, out.width="70%"}
    library(dplyr)
    df <- data.frame(order = c(1, 4, 3, 2),
                        score = c(90, 80, 70, 60),
                        weight = c(1, 1, 1, 1),
                        goal = c("F", "A", "I", "R"),
                        name_flower = c("Findable", "Accessible", "Interoperable", "Reusable"),
                        name_supra = c(NA, NA, NA, NA),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% arrange(order)
    d1_colors <- c( "#c70a61", "#ff582d", "#1a6379", "#60c5e4")
    plot_flower(df, title = "FAIR Metrics", fixed_colors=TRUE, colors = d1_colors)
```
