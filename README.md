Flowers is a package for generating flower plots. It was derived from
code from Jim Regetz at NCEAS, and then rewritten and extended by the
OHI project. This package formalizes the approach into an easily
re-usable function for generating custom flower plots for multiple
scenarios.

## Installation

You can install the development version of flowers from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mbjones/flowers) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mbjones/flowers")
```

You can install the released version of flowers from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("flowers")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a flower plot:

``` r
library(flowers)

# coming soon....
```
